# Securing-Cloud-Storage-Using-Homomorphic-Encryption-
Python-based system for secure and efficient cloud file storage. It converts text files to ASCII, encrypts them using the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme (via the TenSEAL library), compresses the encrypted data with gzip, and then uploads the final, secure file to Dropbox. The method prioritizes both data privacy and storage efficiency.
